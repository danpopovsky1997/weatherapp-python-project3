[Live Running Program](https://weather-app-project-3.herokuapp.com/)

The Weather App is an application that was developed to demonstrate some of the uses Python may have when it comes to building software applications. This application aims to show the user how Python is used to create basic functionality using various functions.

Within this application the user will be able to obtain informaton about a specific city and it's: 1. Weather type, 2. temperature in degrees celcius and lastly 3. Date and time of the city. Although simple, it provides an insight into how information is obtained from various API and communicated within a terminal.

## Software Used
- Python
- Heroku

## Features
The application has one feature in which it provides a total of 3 pieces of information. The intended use of the application is for the user to obtain information about the current weather, date and time. The process of obtaining this information is: Inputting a city of choice (it is important to be precise about the location) in which it provides the user with:
A. The weather type
B. The temperature in Degrees Celcius
C. The date and time of the location inputted

Although a simple function, it shows how Python is used when it comes to extracting informtaion from the API.

### Planned Features
To expand this project further and to allow the user to interact more with the application within the terminal I have planned to:
- Implement a process in which inputs a location, and in turn asks the user to select from three options and input either A, B or C, the options being:
A. Would you like to know the weather?
B. Would you like to know the temperature?
C. Would you like to know the date?
- Implement a loop system so the user does not have to run the program each time before inputting a location
- Implement the use of eircodes and postcodes to allow for more precise and accurate data
